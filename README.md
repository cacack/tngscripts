==========

Various scripts for use with TNG (http://lythgoes.net/genealogy/software.php).

adjplaces.pl = Perl script to adjust all of the fields in the various tables that hold location information.  Tested with TNG 9.2.0.
adjplaces.php = a PHP version of adjplaces.pl.  No arguments and it just queries the database. Use 'details=1' to return a listing of all the locations found.  Use 'update=1' to actually update the database.  Tested with TNG 9.2.0.
